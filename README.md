**Explanation of Components:**
*   **User/Browser:** The end-user interacting with the website through their web browser.
*   **Next.js Application:** The core of the application, responsible for routing, rendering pages (SSR/SSG), API routes (if any), and serving static assets. It acts as the orchestrator for the entire frontend experience.
*   **React Components:** The building blocks of the UI. These are individual, reusable pieces of the interface (e.g., buttons, cards, navigation items).
*   **Shadcn UI Library:** A collection of pre-built, accessible, and customizable UI components. Developers can copy and paste the code directly into the project, allowing for full control and customization.
*   **Radix UI Primitives:** The foundation for Shadcn UI components, providing unstyled, accessible components that handle complex UI interactions (e.g., dropdowns, dialogs, form elements).
*   **Custom Semantic Components:** Project-specific React components (`<Header>`, `<Footer>`, `<Section>`) that wrap standard HTML elements with added styling or layout logic, ensuring semantic structure and consistency.
*   **Tailwind CSS:** The styling layer of the application. It's a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development by composing classes directly in the markup.
*   **Static Assets & Data:** Images, videos, fonts, and static content (like the text for privacy policies or club descriptions) that are served directly by the Next.js application.
*   **External APIs / CMS (Optional/Future):** A placeholder for potential future integrations with backend services or Content Management Systems to provide dynamic content (e.g., event listings, blog posts, member profiles).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   **Node.js**: `v18.x` or higher (LTS recommended)
    *   Check your version: `node -v`
*   **npm** (Node Package Manager): `v9.x` or higher (comes with Node.js)
    *   Check your version: `npm -v`
*   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
    *   Check your version: `git --version`

<details>
<summary>üí° **Detailed Prerequisite Installation**</summary>

*   **Node.js & npm**:
    The easiest way to install Node.js (which includes npm) is to download the official installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/). Choose the LTS version.
    Alternatively, use a version manager like `nvm` (Node Version Manager):
    ```bash
    # Install nvm (if not already installed)
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
    # Source nvm
    source ~/.bashrc # or ~/.zshrc, etc.
    # Install the latest LTS version of Node.js
    nvm install --lts
    nvm use --lts
    ```
*   **Git**:
    Follow the instructions on the [official Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for your operating system.
</details>

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the project dependencies.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/GDSC-FSC/gdsc-farmingdale-website.git
    cd gdsc-farmingdale-website
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    Choose your preferred package manager:
    *   **npm**
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    *   **Yarn** (if installed globally)
        ```bash
        yarn install
        ```
    *   **pnpm** (if installed globally)
        ```bash
        pnpm install
        ```
    <details>
    <summary>üí° **Using pnpm for faster installation**</summary>
    `pnpm` is often faster and more efficient with disk space. If you want to use `pnpm`, install it globally first:
    ```bash
    npm install -g pnpm
    pnpm install
    ```
    </details>

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

### Configuration
Most configurations are handled through `package.json`, `tailwind.config.ts`, and `next.config.js`.

*   **Environment Variables:**
    Currently, this project does not rely on specific environment variables for basic operation. If future features require API keys or sensitive information, they would be managed via a `.env.local` file.
    *   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
        ```
        # Example: API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    *   Ensure `.env.local` is listed in `.gitignore` (which it is by default in Next.js projects) to prevent it from being committed to version control.
*   **`tailwind.config.ts`**: Defines Tailwind CSS configuration, including themes, colors, and content paths.
*   **`components.json`**: Configures Shadcn UI aliases and styling preferences. The current setup uses the "new-york" style with CSS variables for theming.

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to Top](#-table-of-contents)

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode
To run the application in development mode with hot-reloading:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```
The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`. Any changes you make to the code will automatically refresh the browser.

#### Production Build
To create an optimized production build of the application:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
```
This command compiles the application into static assets and optimized JavaScript bundles in the `.next` directory, ready for deployment.

#### Running in Production (Locally)
After building the application, you can serve the production build locally:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```
The application will run in a production-like environment, typically on `http://localhost:3000`. This is useful for testing the final deployed version locally before actual deployment.

## üí° Usage & Workflows
This section outlines how users interact with the deployed application and provides guidance for developers on common tasks.

### Common Use Cases

*   **Browsing Club Information:**
    *   Navigate to the homepage to see general announcements and a quick overview of GDSC-FSC.
    *   Use the navigation bar to find specific sections like "About," "Events," "Projects," or "Contact."
*   **Finding Events:**
    *   Visit the "Events" section to see upcoming workshops, meetings, and social gatherings.
    *   Click on individual event listings for details, registration links, and schedules.
*   **Accessing Legal Documents:**
    *   Links in the footer typically lead to "Privacy Policy," "Terms of Service," and "Accessibility Statement" pages.
*   **Learning About the Club:**
    *   The "About" page provides details on GDSC's mission, leadership, and how to get involved.
*   **Contacting the Club:**
    *   The "Contact" section (or footer) provides email addresses or links to social media for inquiries.

### Developer Workflows

#### Adding a New Page
1.  Create a new `page.tsx` file inside the `app/` directory, following Next.js's file-system routing conventions (e.g., `app/new-page/page.tsx`).
2.  Define your React component within this file.
3.  Add the new page to the `Navbar` component (or `constants/index.ts` if navigation links are centralized) if it needs to be accessible via the main navigation.

#### Adding a Shadcn UI Component
1.  Use the Shadcn UI CLI to add components:
    ```bash
    npx shadcn-ui@latest add <component-name>
    ```
    For example, to add an `Alert` component: `npx shadcn-ui@latest add alert`.
2.  The component code will be added to `components/ui/`. You can then import and use it in your pages or other components.

#### Styling with Tailwind CSS
*   Apply Tailwind utility classes directly in your JSX:
    ```jsx
    <div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
        This is a styled div.
    </div>
    ```
*   For complex or reusable styles, consider creating custom components or extending Tailwind's theme in `tailwind.config.ts`.

#### Working with TypeScript
*   Ensure all new files (excluding config files) are `.ts` or `.tsx`.
*   Leverage interfaces and types in `types/` for data structures and component props to maintain type safety.

#### Running Linters
The project is configured with ESLint. You can manually run the linter to check for code quality and style issues:
```bash
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
# or
pnpm lint
```
It's recommended to integrate ESLint into your IDE (e.g., VS Code with the ESLint extension) for real-time feedback.

## üöß Limitations, Known Issues & Future Roadmap
Every project has areas for improvement and planned enhancements. This section outlines what the GDSC Farmingdale Website currently lacks, any known problems, and what's envisioned for its future.

### Current Limitations
*   **Static Content Management:** Most of the content (events, club descriptions, member showcases) is currently hardcoded within components or static data files. There is no dedicated Content Management System (CMS) or backend database.
    *   _Impact:_ Requires developer intervention to update core content, which can be inefficient for non-technical club members.
*   **No User Authentication/Profiles:** The website does not support user login, member profiles, or personalized experiences.
*   **Limited Dynamic Features:** While built on Next.js, current implementation relies heavily on static rendering. Features requiring real-time updates or complex server-side logic (e.g., event registration, live chat) are not yet implemented.
*   **Basic SEO (Out-of-the-box Next.js):** While Next.js provides good SEO fundamentals, there isn't extensive meta-tag management or sitemap generation specifically tailored for dynamic content (which is currently limited).
*   **No Integrated Search Functionality:** Users cannot search for specific events, projects, or information directly on the site.

### Known Issues
*   **Occasional hydration warnings in development mode:** Due to `next-themes` or specific Shadcn components, you might see client-side hydration warnings in the browser console during development. These generally do not affect production functionality or user experience.
*   **Accessibility Review Pending:** While components from Radix UI and Shadcn UI are inherently accessible, a comprehensive, site-wide accessibility audit has not yet been performed to ensure compliance with all WCAG guidelines.

### Future Roadmap
The following features and enhancements are planned for future iterations of the GDSC Farmingdale Website:

*   **Dynamic Content Management System Integration:**
    *   Integrate with a headless CMS (e.g., Strapi, Contentful, Sanity.io) or Firebase/Supabase for managing events, blog posts, member projects, and club news without code changes.
    *   Implement Next.js API routes to fetch and serve dynamic content.
*   **Event Management System:**
    *   Allow GDSC officers to add, edit, and remove events through a simple interface.
    *   Potentially integrate with external event platforms (e.g., Google Calendar, Eventbrite API).
    *   Implement RSVP or registration functionalities.
*   **Member Showcase/Portfolio:**
    *   Section for GDSC members to display their projects, skills, and contributions.
*   **Blog/News Section:**
    *   A dedicated area for club announcements, tech articles, and member stories.
*   **Enhanced SEO:**
    *   Implement dynamic meta-tag generation for each page.
    *   Generate a `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt` automatically.
*   **Search Functionality:**
    *   Add a site-wide search bar to help users quickly find information.
*   **User Authentication (Optional/Future):**
    *   Allow members to log in for personalized content, access to exclusive resources, or event management.
*   **Performance Audits & Optimizations:**
    *   Regular Lighthouse audits to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
    *   Implement advanced caching strategies where applicable.
*   **Comprehensive Accessibility Audit:**
    *   Conduct a thorough review of the entire site to ensure maximum accessibility for all users.
*   **Automated Testing:**
    *   Integrate unit tests (e.g., with Jest/React Testing Library) and end-to-end tests (e.g., with Playwright/Cypress) to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.

### FAQ
Here are answers to some frequently asked questions about the project.

<details>
<summary>ü§î How do I update content on the website?</summary>
Currently, most core content (e.g., descriptions, event details if not dynamically loaded) needs to be updated directly in the relevant React components or static data files within the codebase. For example, to change text on the homepage, you would edit `app/page.tsx`.

In the future, with CMS integration, content updates will be possible through a user-friendly interface without requiring code changes.
</details>

<details>
<summary>üö´ Why are there no event listings or dynamic data?</summary>
The current version of the website is primarily a static presentation layer. It's designed to be easily extendable to integrate with a backend or headless CMS. The roadmap includes plans for dynamic content management.
</details>

<details>
<summary>üåê Can I deploy this project to another hosting provider besides Vercel?</summary>
Yes! While Next.js is optimized for Vercel, it can be deployed to any Node.js compatible environment. You can use platforms like Netlify, AWS Amplify, Heroku, or a custom server. Refer to the [Next.js Deployment Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for detailed instructions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>‚ôø How accessible is the website?</summary>
The website uses Shadcn UI components, which are built on Radix UI primitives. Radix UI focuses heavily on accessibility, providing excellent foundations for keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and screen reader compatibility. However, a full, comprehensive accessibility audit for the entire site's custom content and layout has not yet been conducted. We strive to maintain high accessibility standards.

### Troubleshooting
Common issues and their solutions.

<details>
<summary>üõë `Error: Cannot find module '...'` or missing dependencies.</summary>
This usually means that the project dependencies are not fully installed or are corrupted.
*   **Solution:** Delete your `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`), then reinstall:
    ```bash
    rm -rf node_modules
    rm package-lock.json # or yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml
    npm install # or yarn install, pnpm install
    ```
</details>

<details>
<summary>üö® ESLint errors prevent `npm run dev` or `npm run build`.</summary>
Next.js applications with ESLint can sometimes enforce linting during build steps.
*   **Solution 1 (Recommended):** Address the ESLint errors in your code. The error messages will guide you to the problematic lines.
*   **Solution 2 (Temporary/Override):** If you need to quickly bypass linting for a build (e.g., for testing deployment, not recommended for final code), you can modify `next.config.js`:
    ```javascript
    /** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
    const nextConfig = {
      eslint: {
        ignoreDuringBuilds: true, // Only use this if you know what you're doing
      },
    }
    module.exports = nextConfig
    ```
    **WARNING:** Ignoring ESLint during builds can lead to quality issues. Only use this for temporary debugging.
</details>

<details>
<summary>üîÑ Changes are not reflected after saving files.</summary>
*   **Solution 1:** Ensure your development server is running (`npm run dev`).
*   **Solution 2:** Sometimes the HMR (Hot Module Replacement) can get stuck. Try restarting the development server (`Ctrl+C` then `npm run dev`).
*   **Solution 3:** Clear your browser cache or try a hard refresh (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`).
